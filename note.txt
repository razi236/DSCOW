Check why is error on f2?
I think its due to multiple futs with same sync schema in I.

-> Finish other cases and write user manual to get feedback from others

** Non-returning sync call should be Unit var = sync_call.
** Sync Call is not working with non-returning method call.
Sync call is an exp, and it must be either in assignment_stmt. So better is to avoid from unit return type and return 0 if don't want to return anything.


** [Done] Write user manual of the Rpl language and the tool (compiler and cost analysis).
 Summarize in simple words, what the language is for and what the tools do and then go for technical details.


***     Our language do not have Map, List and loops in the syntax.

***      To Do (31 October)
