[Wait for generic future type]        Task Dependencies
[Done]                                Resource Qualities Declaration
[With Timed ABS]                      Deadline Missed Notification
[With JAVA Backend?]                  Cost Analysis
[Done]                                Try to check in parameter list when 1st basic type comes stop.
[?]                                   Comparison with other Cost Analysis
[?]                                   Find some tools targeting workflow plannings
[?]                                   Tools that targets programs (focus actor programs)
[?]                                   SAC paper will be tool oriented



Check why is error on f2?
I think its due to multiple futs with same sync schema in I.

-> Finish other cases and write user manual to get feedback from others

** Non-returning sync call should be Unit var = sync_call.
** Sync Call is not working with non-returning method call.
Sync call is an exp, and it must be either in assignment_stmt. So better is to avoid from unit return type and return 0 if don't want to return anything.


** [Done] Write user manual of the Rpl language and the tool (compiler and cost analysis).
 Summarize in simple words, what the language is for and what the tools do and then go for technical details.


***     Our language do not have Map, List and loops in the syntax.

***      To Do (31 October)

[?]       In case, if you get a chance to update the SCP paper, please remove f1,f2 from Line 12 of Figure 11.
[Done]   At Deadline missed proper message should be displayed, which method and running on which object.
[need to update parsere]       In case of future initialized inside conditional branch, and used as dependency in method call out of conditional branch, it should be an error.
[Done]   Make class diagram of pathologyWorkflow.abs.
[Done]   DataBase integration within the tool ?
[?]      Can we couple multiple workflows running on different machines ?
[67]     Document all the leaves I had, sick leaves and welfare leaves. For covid leaves apply for that.
[Done]   Also mention the reason why you should have to apply for leave. Ask Faustin.
[]       Evaluation of our tool with other available tools, to have some benchmark,
[]       Write future plan in some draft bullet form and review yourself what you want to achieve with respect ot available time and contribution.
[]       Have a look at other conferences, like BPM or other related ones. Don't stick on formal method conferences.

*  Implement a GUI with JDBC with swing API, to add and remove resources in the database.
*  Graphical Model to Rpl code translation


TO DO: 7th November 2022.

[]      preprocessing, and capture which future have been created and synchronised.
[]      check alt paper for benchmarks.(how they compared with other tools).
[]      ask Faustin for extension (when, how and what)?
[]      resources in different tables based on type of resources etc.
[]      use resource capacity in consTime to have an idea how much time a resource take to finish a task, also how much the other resources will consume?
[]      Job have 100 times unit deadline and resources have some capacity, check which resource suits best to do this job optimally?
[]      Parametrised consTime() with respect to resource capacity.
[]      1st dry run and check how it can be done?
[]      Think in a way that we can have a short paper from it.
[***]   what should be in a paper, what need to be done in 1 year.
[]      Paper submission in FM conference.



[Done] Write script to translate and execute the program.
[]  Extension should be *.rpl.
[]  seperate the abstools and rpltools
[]  user should clone with abstools seperately
[]  makefile, instead of .sh extension
[]  If want to discuss can discuss on first week of January
