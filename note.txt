Check value of ta and t in cases with dependency



                                      Non-returning sync call should be Unit var = sync_call.
-> Check Call1Exp issue is adding I and ta, from where these values are adding and updating
-> Sync method call is not working
-> Finish other cases and write user manual to get feedback from others
